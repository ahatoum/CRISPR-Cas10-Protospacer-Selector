Instructions to Run the Code:

Download and place the two files (MainScript.py, GNfunctions.py) in the same directory. Edit the MainScript.py with your tag and genome sequence (variable gene). When the code runs, it creates a “Results.txt” in the same directory that presents the tabulated results.


Code Description:

MainScript.py takes a gene sequence (in 5’-3’ direction) and crRNA 5’-tag (in 5’-3’ direction) as user inputs, and as outputs, produces all possible 35-nucleotide protospacers that exhibit zero complementarity between the protospacer adjacent anti-tag region and the crRNA 5’-tag. A flow chart depicting the algorithm appears in Figure S1. Briefly, the reverse complement of the tag is first obtained to generate an eight-nucleotide comparison template. Within a loop, a window of eight nucleotides that progressively moves rightward is copied from the gene sequence and compared to the template derived from the user’s tag. In this comparison, when corresponding nucleotides are “not” equal to each other, a logic true is produced. Then the results of these Boolean comparisons are subjected to a logic AND operation among themselves, which yields true only when there is no match at any position between the nucleotides in the moving window and the comparison template. As the loop proceeds, each time a logic true is produced, the beginning location of the moving window, which is required to be at a position >35 nucleotides within the gene, is recorded in an array with respect to the original gene sequence input, and a “possibility” counter is incremented by one. Once this loop is completed, another loop begins, in which for each position a logic true is produced (called a “match”), 35 nucleotides to the left of the match is extracted from the gene sequence—this is called the permissible protospacer. The reverse complement of the protospacer is also generated as an output to indicate the corresponding spacer sequence that would need to be cloned into editing and targeting constructs.
